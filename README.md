# WebRobot

Website interface to controll the Create 2 iRobot through the net with a livestream. This allows for easy, modular updates that can be implemented offline with access anywhere.


TODO bug fixes: 
 -  Add a time limit between movement commands? ~0.2 seconds
 -  Possibly make the image reload as soon as connection established?
 -  What if the robot disconnects? We need to update indicator? Or just refresh page?
 
 TODO Long term:
  - Intergrate voice activation/commands (google home/alexa but portable)
