# WebRobot

Website interface to controll the Create 2 iRobot through the net with a livestream. This allows for easy, modular updates that can be implemented offline with access anywhere.


TODO: 
 -  Add a time limit between movement commands? ~0.2 seconds
 -  Possibly make the image reload as soon as connection established?
 -  Connection status still stays red even if Connected...
 -  Robot interface code is broken when user disconects from bot's server
